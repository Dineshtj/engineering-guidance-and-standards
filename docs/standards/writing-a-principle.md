## Title

Writing a Principle

---

## Description

Home Office Engineering Principles should follow the recommended [format for an Architectural Principle as defined by the Open Group in TOGAF9](https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/chap20.html)

---

## Requirement(s)

- A Principle MUST have a Name
- A Principle MUST have a Statement
- A Principle MUST have a Rationale
- A Principle MUST state the expected Implications of that Principle
- A Principle MUST show when it was Last Updated

---

## Rationale

Principles will include each of the components as described below, so that intent and implications are clear.

### Name

State the essence of the principle and make it easy to remember. Specific technology platforms should not be mentioned in the name or statement of a principle. Avoid ambiguous words in the Name and in the Statement such as: "support", "open", "consider", and remove unnecessary adjectives and adverbs (fluff).

### Statement

Succinctly and unambiguously communicate the fundamental principle. It is vital that the principles statement is unambiguous. The reader should readily discern the answer to: "How does this affect me?".

### Rationale

State why the principle is important and why it has been adopted. Highlight the technical and business benefits of adhering to the principle. Do not oversimplify or overestimate the merit of the principle. 

### Implications

Highlight the requirements for carrying out the principle - in terms of approaches, activities and tasks. The potential impact to the business and consequences of working to, or not working to, these requirements should be clearly stated.

### Last Updated

Rather than providing versioning, show the date the principle was last updated.
